Deep learning semantic segmentation with U-Net and LinkNet

U-Net: Here I compare a modified U-Net (which uses resnet residual modules) with a modified U-Net that used dilated convolutions.
LinkNet: This is my implementation of LinkNet in keras. I use this network on the Carvana Image Masking challenge dataset.
