    "The U-Net <a href=\"#ref1\">[1]</a> was the most widely implemented deep learning network in the recently concluded [Carvana Image Masking Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge) on Kaggle and the competition was an opportunity to experiment with different \n",
    "[U-Net](#UNet) architectures. The [third place solution](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge/discussion/40199) ([github code](https://github.com/lyakaap/Kaggle-Carvana-3rd-place-solution)) was a modified  U-Net that used dilated convolution blocks in the bottleneck region (the region at the junction of the contracting and expanding paths). This simple change, which was responsible for the high scoring (0.997193) results, used fewer parameters (8.5 million vs something in the range of 34 million for a lower scoring U-Net model 7 or 8 blocks deep) as well. [Dilated convolutional filters](#dilated) increase the receptive field but require far fewer parameters than a deeper network with standard convolution filters. Since the ResNet <a href=\"#ref1\">[2]</a> is a deep network that uses fewer parameters (than older conv-net architectures), a worthwhile experiment would be to replace the dilated convolutions with ResNet [residual blocks](#residual-blocks).\n",

    "#### Methodology\n",
    "There are two or three runs -- some with small changes -- for each of the models. We plot the [results](#Results) for all five runs but show the model summary, data prep, and training steps only for the *U-Net+residual blocks* Run 5.  \n",
    "We only train the models for 5-10 epochs to see how the performance numbers in the initial phase compare. It would take roughly three days (50 mins/epoch x 100 epochs on a NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU platform) to fully train each model and a full set of experiments with multiple runs would be expensive. \n",

    "The models are implemented in Keras with the TensorFlow backend. \n",

    "## Basics of U-Net, Dilated Convolutions and Residual Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='UNet'></a>\n",
    "#### U-Net\n",
    "The U-Net is an example of a FCN Encoder-Decoder architecture. The Encoder is a standard convolutional neural network which learns features for classification. During this process, downsampling operations reduce the spatial resolution, so an upsampling stage is needed to restore the spatial resolution for semantic segmentation. This is achieved by the Decoder network. The SegNet is an example of an Encoder-Decoder where two VGG16 networks, one a downsampling path and the other an upsampling path, mirror each other. In the U-Net, the downsampling and upsampling path are connected via a convolutional block. This set of convolutional filters lets the network go deeper and preserves the dimensions of the contracted segmentation maps at the same time. Some variants of this block could be the use of dilated convolutions or a bottleneck layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='dilated'></a>\n",
    "#### Dilated Convolutional Filters\n",
    "Dilated (or atrous) convolutional filters are used in semantic segmentation architectures to increase the receptive field but to do so with far fewer parameters than a deeper network with standard convolution filters would require. To see why, note that a 3x3 filter with a dilation rate of 2 has the same FOV as a 5x5 filter. The 3x3 filter uses 9 parameters whereas the 5x5 filter uses 25. (It should be noted that while the max pooling operation also increases the FOV it is also associated with aggressive downsampling and so is not used in a U-Net once the features are learned.) \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='residual-blocks'></a>\n",
    "#### Residual Blocks\n",
    "ResNets employ residual blocks to create deep networks. The basic residual block consists of a sequence of convolutional layers chained by a skip connection which ensures that the input signal is backpropagated.  The ResNet50 residual block that we use is made up of three sequential convolutions:\n",
    "  1. 1x1 convolutions (this is the NiN concept: features that are correlated are efficiently combined reducing redundancy and this reduces the number of parameters effectively creating a *bottleneck*)\n",
    "  2. 3x3 convolutions (to get a rich set of new feature combinations; this is computationally expensive but due to the preceding bottleneck step the computational burden is significantly reduced) \n",
    "  3. 1x1 operation (to expand the number of filters usually restoring the output to the original block input)\n",
    "  \n",
    "This is shown in the figure below:\n",

    "The initial numbers (from 10 epochs for Run 5, 5 epochs for the other runs) for both the *U-Net+residual blocks* and the *U-Net+dilated blocks* are comparable and both are very high in terms of the dice coefficients. The U-Net is a good baseline for binary segmentation but these start values were much higher than for a generic U-Net without the modified bottleneck. \n",
    "There is some indication that the *U-Net+dilated blocks* is more stable but we would need to train longer and tune each of these runs to assess that.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The U-Nets were trained from scratch using an NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU computing platform. It took around 40-50 mins per epoch.\n",
    "The *U-Net+dilated blocks* with 8.6 million parameters took longer than the *U-Net+residual blocks*  with 3.5 million parameters. The run times are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "*U-Net+dilted blocks*\n",
    "* 3300 secs for the first 5 epochs on two runs\n",
    "               \n",
    "*U-Net+residual blocks* \n",
    "* 2700 secs for the first 5 epochs on two runs\n",
    "* 2250 secs for first 10 epochs (the experiments were run a month apart during which time the code was rewritten and there is also the possibility the computing resources on the Crestle platform changed)\n",
    "\n",
    "The *U-Net+residual blocks* seems like it could be a time-efficient replacement for the *U-Net+dilated blocks*. "
